Relase Planning: RP addresses decisions related to selecting and assigning features to create a sequence of consecutive product release[1].
1. " The art and science of release planning"

WEEK 46
Did a basic search on research planning and large scale requirements engineering.
found the following articles(summary will be provided in the reflective report)
A systematic review on strategic release planning models
by Mikael Svahnberg, Tony Gorschek , Robert Feldt , Richard Torkar , Saad Bin Saleem ,Muhammad Usman Shafique 
The art and science of software release planning(summary is in seminar)

WEEK 47
Started clarifying the given requirements by posting questions:
on issue 1: Maybe if we can provide some information to user, when they start the system might mitigate this.
on issue 2: what information will be presented to the user?, can the system manager have access to modify the information viewed by the user?
on issue 3: Does login prevent this issue? also restricting different users in the system based on their priorities prevent the system from unauthorised use.
on issue 4: users can be differentiated by their priorities. Students are basic users and their functionality is to read the courses etc.
on issue 9: To the system manager or course manager or both?
on issue 11: what information shall be displayed on the personalised start page?
on issue 12: Should the course start page show the participants in the course, Discussions, roll call?
on issue 13: Maybe providing an internal search engine will help the users find information quickly.
on issue 14: what should be the format of attachments? Security issues might arise if we allow all formats.
on issue 15: Are the course participants allowed to share the files in the discussion?
on issue 17: is the course responsible does the things mentioned above, or the system manager?who is responsible for students registration?

WEEK 48
While continuing on clarifying, worked on different models for prioritizing the requirements and also adding estimates to the requirements.
Read the following papers:
"Towards Modeling Guidelines for Capturing the Cost of Improving Software Product Quality in Release Planning"
The paper focuses on the QUPER model's cost based prioritising.

WEEK 49 
Started adding new requirements based on the comments received previously.
Started classifying them so that they could be well understood.
Started adding dependencies among the requirements to simplifying the requirements.
